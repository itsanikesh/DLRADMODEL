# DLRADMODEL
These are the codes to train the Deep Neural Network (DNN) based radiation model. These codes are trained from the input-output dataset for Shortwave (SW) and Longwave (LW) radiation. After training these codes gives the weight matrices and bias vectors for SW and LW radiation calculation. These weight matrices and bias vectors are then implemented in SP-E3SM. The same case is repeated with SP-E3SM. The SW and LW radiation calculations are now carried out by the DNNs via matrix multiplication. We have used DGEMM as the matrix multiplier. People interested implement these matrix multiplications in an actual code can contact me, and I will be glad to help.
